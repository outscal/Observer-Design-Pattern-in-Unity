## 3. Problems being solved by Observer Pattern
Your code can get messy in case of many different parameters in your game like,
1. If multiple developers are working don't he same project
2. Code becomes Spaghetti
3. Missing element that breaks the code
 
To avoid this, developers use this design pattern to provide a loose coupling between an subject and one or more objects. It allows the developers to remove or mimalize the probability of any missing elements that may break the game.
