## **Why Observer Pattern?**

Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, its depenedent objects are to be notified automatically. Observer pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.
A real world example of observer pattern can be any social media platform such as Facebook or twitter. When a person updates his status – all his followers gets the notification. A follower can follow or unfollow another person at any point of time.
It is also widely adopted and used in the gaming industry.
